# Contributing to C Traceback
Welcome, contributors! Thank you for contributing to C Traceback.

Currently, the project is only developed by me (the repo owner), but any contributions are welcomed!

## How Can I Contribute?
* **Testing**: Currently the tests are very simple. I only check whether the terminal output "Traceback" or whether the program returns 0. It is because I only wanted to check whether it works on all platforms. It would be great if we have some better test cases that works with ctest.
* **Features**: While I don't have any new features in mind, any suggestions are welcomed.
* **Bugs**: Feel free to open an issue if you find any bugs, or even fix it through a pull request.

## Checklist for pull requests
Please note the followings before submitting a pull request:
* All committed code should be formatted by clang-format
